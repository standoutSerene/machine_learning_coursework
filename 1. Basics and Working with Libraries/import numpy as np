# if we sample from a probability distribution, we will get more points which have higher probabs.
# for histogram, data is divided into ranges
# in a histogram, each range is a bucket, and on y-axis is the number of points in that bucket
# 1000 is the number of points that I want to have
# 100 is the number of buckets that I want to have
# if we decerase the number of buckets, we'll see that the width of the bars will increase
